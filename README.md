# Bruteforce Detector

A Python script to detect **suspicious login attempts** from server logs. This tool helps identify potential brute-force attacks by counting failed login attempts per IP address.

## Features

- Reads server logs (`log.txt`) and analyzes failed login attempts.
- Flags IPs with **3 or more consecutive failed login attempts**.
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- Ideal for small-scale security monitoring and learning purposes.

## How it Works

- Reads each line of the log file.

- Looks for "LOGIN FAIL" entries.

- Extracts the IP address and counts failed attempts.

- Flags any IP with 3 or more failed attempts as suspicious.
